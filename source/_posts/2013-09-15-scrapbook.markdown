Another app idea of mine is codename scrapbook. Often times, I find myself browsing through all kinds of webpages, PDFs, videos when I am trying to learn a new language, framework or technology. Things get out of hand pretty quickly. It becomes hard to follow and remember where I leave things off, when I want to pick up later. Browser often becomes a mess with 120 tabs open.


In order to solve this problem it will be good to have a service where it's easy to dump links, text, video, in order to pick those up later.
