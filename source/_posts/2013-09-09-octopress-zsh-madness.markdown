I cannot believe I spent 3 hours on octopress installation. I deleted the repository 5 times and try to re-install only to find out that all problems were related to zsh. Basically don't bother installing octopress on zsh. Just change the shell to bash and go ahead. It won't take more than 5 minutes.
