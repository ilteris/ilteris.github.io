[Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) is a great tool for reading documentation offline
of your favorite framework or library. You can also generate [your own docsets]( http://kapeli.com/docsets) and host them as feeds so anyone can use it.
I have found an open source iOS project on github (https://github.com/omz/DocSets-for-iOS) for reading the mac os x / iOS docsets
which is a bit dated but have not been able to find any project that's
compatible with Dash docsets in general. Maybe a side project?
