If you ever find yourself working with two different instances of vim under mac
os x using tmux, copy/paste will not work like you expect it to work. Go to
https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard and read more about it.
Once you follow the instructions, then it works flawlessly. My love/hate
relationship with tmux continues.
