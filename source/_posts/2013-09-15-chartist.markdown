This is a project I have been thinking about for a while. I envisioned it as a service for my own needs when I want to be able save charts along with typical information like entry, exit points to look at them later.


For a very simple start, I need a few things to make this work:
1. Figure out a way to route the screen shot of the chart from desktop using mac os x screenshot application to the chartist application.
2. Get a few inputs from the user including the derivative symbol, entry price, exit price.
3. Try to grab the feed from the yahoo finance API.
